## Exploring Religion and Spiritually

In	this	week’s	session,	facilitators	KJ	Thomas,	MSW,	RSW	and	Jillian	Crabbe,	MSW,	RSW	were	joined	by	guest	
speaker;	Alex	Philippi,	BEd,	MDip,	MA,	Chaplain,	The	Royal	presenting:	 Returning to or exploring your spiritual
community for the first time.

Another aspect of wellbeing can include spiritual health. Religious and spiritual communities can help connect a person to
a number of health benefits. They can be found together, but also can be looked at separately. Religion, is a structured
form of beliefs, usually connected to a group of people who share those beliefs. Religion can provide teachings to help a
person choose how to live their life. It can encourage social connection with like-minded people creating a sense of
belonging; aims to offer safe and social engagements, and can include designated times together, as well as holidays.
Amongst connection to a community of people, religion can also offer meaning to difficult situations, and lessons to learn
in hard times. Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity are all forms of religion. Spirituality could be described as a
connection to something larger than the self; a looking inwards for connection to the larger life around us. It can help a
person find empowerment through their choice to focus on areas of connection that help shape what they believe and how
they grow. This can be done through things like meditation, self reflection, philosophy, and expression through art, poetry,
writing, and other creative outputs. Spirituality can help renew a sense of belonging and interaction with the world’s
physical environment.

## Tips for Exploring Religious and Spiritual Communities

-  If	uncomfortable	to	go	in	person,	many	places	have	online/virtual	spaces	to	begin	exploration.	
- Attend	with	a	friend	or	family	member,	or,	if	you	call	ahead,	some	places	have	people	who	will	greet and accompany	you.	
- Remember	that	feeling	nervous	or	anxious	is	normal	for	new	experiences.	Try	and	remember	other	times	
you	felt	the	same,	and	positive	outcomes	that	came	from	trying	none	the	less.
-  Religious	and	spiritual	communities	are	not	filled	with	perfect	people,	but	rather	people	who	are	looking	
for	similar	connections.	
- Getting	to	know	the	community	you	are	exploring	can	take	time,	it	can	also	take	time	for	them	to	get	to	
know	you.	

- It’s	okay	to	try	different	places	on	your	journey	to	finding	what	helps	you	feel	connected.

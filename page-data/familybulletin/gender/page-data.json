The plus is to incorporate and acknowledge that our identities, and terms evolve and\\nchange. Some people shorten this to LGBT, but it remains important to be aware and acknowledge all\\nthe variations of beauty our minds and bodies come in. Another term you might hear is Queer. Where\\nit once was used in a derogatory manor, for some folks, Queer has become a reclaimed word. Queer\\ncan be an umbrella term for minorities in the LGBTQIA2S+ community. Another term relatively new in\\nmainstream language is cisgender. This refers to a person who identifies with the sex and gender they\\nwere assigned at birth. Lastly, appropriate pronoun use has become recognized and encouraged. This\\nmeans referring to the person in the pronouns they identify with.

Our focus is on\\npresenting our bodies in a way we are comfortable, and respecting the choices of others to do the\\nsame. With all these variables to consider, one might wonder how we are to know the appropriate way\\nto address someone- and the answer is, we ask.

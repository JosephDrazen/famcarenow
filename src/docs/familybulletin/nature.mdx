## Nature and Your Mental Health

In	this	weeks	session, facilitators KJ	Thomas,	MSW,	RSW	and	Jillian	Crabbe,	MSW,	RSW were	joined	by	
guest	speaker;	Andrea	Prazmowski	presenting		“Nature	and	Your	Mental	Health”. Nature	and	Forest	
Therapy	is	a	research-based	framework	that	supports	wellness	through	immersion	in	natural	settings.	
Additionally,	it	can	help	to	remind	of	our	place	within the	world,	and	bring	healing	through	that	
remembering.	While	Nature	&	Forest	Therapy	is	a	newer	therapy,	the	powers	of	nature	have	been	long	
known	and	practiced	amongst	Indigenous	teachings.	

Nature	is	a	power that	surrounds	us,	and	offers	us	far	more	than	just	it’s beauty.	Over	the	years,	studies	
have	been	performed	that	bring fourth evidence	of	the impacts	nature	can	have.	One	study	showed	that	
even	having	a window view	of	natural	scenery	can	strengthen	healing.	Time	outdoors	can	improve	moods,	
expand	ways	of	thinking,	and	give	more	meaning	to	life.	This	has	become	so	evident	in	studies,	that	some	
doctors	have	begun	writing	prescriptions	for	more	time	in	nature.	Some	parks	have	begun	to	waive	the	
fees	for	folks	entering	on	doctors	orders.	Over,	and	over	again,	the	scientists,	doctors,	and	poets	agree,	
spending	time	in nature,	improves	health.	

In	today’s culture,	we	do	not	spend	as	much	time	outdoors	as	we	once	did	years	ago.	Often,	we	need	to	
remind	ourselves,	or	schedule	special	time	to	be	outside.	The	Japanese	have	long	known	and	studied	the	
benefits	humans	find	in nature.	A	practice	called	Shinrin-Yoku,	meaning,	“to	immerse	oneself	in	the	
atmosphere	of	the	forest”,	has	come	to	be	known	as	“forest	bathing”.	Through	monitoring	devices,	studies	
showed	improvement	in	the	function	of	vital	organs	when	taking	walks	in	the	forest	as	opposed	to	cities.	
Things	like	reduced	blood	pressure,	reduced	cortisol,	and	improved	heart	rates	were	observed- all	of	
which	reduce	stress.	Additionally,	forest	walks	showed	higher	scores	for	vigor,	and	decreased	scores	for	
depression,	fatigue,	anxiety,	and	confusion.	Nature	has	incredible	abilities	to	nurture	both	our	physical	and	
mental	health.	

When	spending	time	in	nature,	be	present,	slow	down,	follow	your	senses,	and	notice.	Try	to	observe	and	
preserve	the	feelings	that	nature	lends	to	you.	This	can	help	motivate	and	inspire	more	time	in	the	natural	
healing	world	we	live	in.

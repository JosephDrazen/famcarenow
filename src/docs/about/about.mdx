>famcarenow is a mobile-friendly web app designed by family caregivers for family caregivers based on our collective experiences.

## Solving the Puzzle

Navigating the mental health care system does not have to be difficult. famcarenow aims to make information that families and caregivers need more accessible.

## What we do

We are family caregivers and professionals who understand family caregivers’ needs for accessing information and resources – the right resources at the right time. We know first hand of the challenges families face navigating the mental health system, often while stressed and desperate for help. That is why we are designing an App – famcarenow – especially for family caregivers. We want to use and share our collective experience to help others access information quickly no matter where you are at along the mental health journey. 

## The problem facing family caregivers

Caregivers in search of information on the journey face challenges due to the complexity of the mental health system. Caregivers are often flooded with information that they cannot absorb or use and, in the complexity, miss essential pieces of information.

A recent publication, released by the Change Foundation (Sept 2019), “Understanding The Caregiver Experience: Regional Insights to Inform Ontario Health Teams” indicated that 58% of family caregivers turn to the internet for support (over a health care provider and before friends). But many resources are not easily found on the internet as people may not know the best search words to use and there are dead links and misinformation that can be confusing.

When faced with a new dilemma such as a mental health crisis, accessing a family doctor, considering hospitalization, looking for a diagnosis, a worker or therapist, or coping with family caregiver stress and access to help – famcarenow will provide accurate information at your fingertips. Beyond information, family caregivers often need emotional support. famcarenow will also feature a social worker avatar providing hope, encouragement and support along the way.

We have searched for and tried many “mental health apps” that are available including the apps available from the Royal site. It is estimated that there may be 150 000 such apps available worldwide. In our searching to this point we have not found any app or group of apps that use the approach that we present or that target family caregivers as we propose. We believe that our approach is unique.

## Our solution

Family caregivers’ needs change over time but challenges remain consistent across the trajectory of mental illness whether supporting loved ones for less than one year to over 20 years. Transitions coupled with years‘ caregiving impacts families‘ mental health due to stress, responsibilities, lack of knowledge and resources, isolation and burnout. famcarenow’s vision is to enable family caregivers to find themselves along the mental health journey – click and be immediately linked to relevant information, resources, and tips to provide help at the specific point in time where you are at. By including insider tips and strategies provided by family caregivers and sharing them with you, famcarenow provides help beyond linking you to resources… to sharing how to best use these resources, ultimately saving you time and stress. Each particular caregiver’s journey may cover years or decades from the first crisis through multiple hospitalizations, recovery periods with multiple complications and setbacks before some stability may be reached.

famcarenow is based in Ottawa with potential for growth across regions. Drawing from family experience with the mental health system to assist access to the right resources at the right time. famcarenow aims to reduce family burden and duplication of effort by drawing from family experiences.

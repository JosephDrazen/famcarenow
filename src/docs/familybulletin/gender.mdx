## Gender Diversity

Social workers KJ Thomas and Tracey Kent facilitated with guest presenter, Nathan Strayed, MSW,
RSW, from Trailhead Counselling. Nathan gave a presentation on Gender Diversity and Inclusion.

Within the last while we have really begun to see changes in acceptance and understanding of self-
identity, and relationships with others. We want our Family Groups to be supportive safe spaces for

all, and believes in supporting LGBTQIA2S+ communities. To begin, let’s have a look at the acronym
LGBTQIA2S+ and what it means: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual,
and Two-Spirit. The plus is to incorporate and acknowledge that our identities, and terms evolve and
change. Some people shorten this to LGBT, but it remains important to be aware and acknowledge all
the variations of beauty our minds and bodies come in. Another term you might hear is Queer. Where
it once was used in a derogatory manor, for some folks, Queer has become a reclaimed word. Queer
can be an umbrella term for minorities in the LGBTQIA2S+ community. Another term relatively new in
mainstream language is cisgender. This refers to a person who identifies with the sex and gender they
were assigned at birth. Lastly, appropriate pronoun use has become recognized and encouraged. This
means referring to the person in the pronouns they identify with. For some, he or she, does not pair
appropriately with their identity, and in these cases, some may opt to use the pronouns they, or them
or many others.

A common point of misunderstanding can be the differences between sex, and gender. A helpful
resource for this is the Genderbread Person v4.0. The full explanation can be found at
https://www.genderbread.org/. Sex generally refers to the a natomical genitals we are born with, and

not all people are born with “one or the other”. Did you know that just as common as it is to be born
with red hair, so are the births of intersex people? Gender can be described as the identity, and
expression of a person. One of the main things to remember is sex does not equal gender, nor does
gender expression. These are all moving parts and can present in a wide continuum. Our focus is on
presenting our bodies in a way we are comfortable, and respecting the choices of others to do the
same. With all these variables to consider, one might wonder how we are to know the appropriate way
to address someone- and the answer is, we ask. At times, we may mistakenly identify or assume- but
in all of these cases, having respectful dialogue with the person is the right step to take. We are
beginning to move away from the days of pink for girls, and blue for boys- in fact, it was not that long
ago in history that even this standard was reversed. While shifts in societal thinking can be confusing,
we create the standards of acceptance, and therefore we have the power to change these standards to
ensure inclusive communities.

Families can help by creating not only non-judgmental- but also welcoming space for their loved ones.
Often times, people within the LGBTQIA2S+ community experience higher rates of mental health
issues. This is linked to the added stigma that is faced daily, and a health care system that is not yet
fully inclusive. Even when we do not understand, being open to hearing, learning, and continuing to
support our loved ones will help create harmony in the home. There are also great resources to reach
out to, to help support the journey of growth.

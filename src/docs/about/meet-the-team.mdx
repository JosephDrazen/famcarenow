**Meet Denis**
-

Denis Riordan is currently an Adjunct Professor in the Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie University, a family caregiver and a Member of the Family Advisory Council at The Royal Hospital. Denis obtained a PhD in Mathematics at Carleton University in 1972 before commencing a career in mathematics and computer science. He held positions as lecturer, associate professor, professor, Head of Department of Computer Science and Associate Dean Academic of a Faculty of Computer Science over 45 years in four universities in South Africa and Canada. Denis recently retired from a position of Professor of Computer Science and Associate Dean (Academic) at Dalhousie University,

Denis has taught thousands of undergraduate and graduate students, published research papers in both computer science and mathematics and supervised research theses of graduate students. His area of specialization is artificial intelligence. He has been elected president of several academic associations including a university teachers union.

After retiring in 2016 Denis’ life changed abruptly when he became a family caregiver. He spent two years learning his way around the Ontario mental health system. He found the mental health system complex and fractured, difficult to use. Denis was fortunately referred to an excellent and unique series of workshops for family caregivers offered at The Royal. He found the series detailed and comprehensive, not unlike a graduate course at university, covering topics of vital interest and use to family caregivers. The workshops were organized by Juliet Haynes and delivered by social workers, nurses and psychiatrists associated with The Royal Hospital.

CBT looks at the connection between our feelings, thoughts, physical sensations, and actions. CBT acknowledges that you are the expert on your own life, and therefore you are the best person to determine what areas make the most sense to address. In CBT, you work with a clinician in active participation where together thoughts, feelings, and behaviours are monitored for opportunities of positive long lasting change at a neurological level. The impacts of CBT tend to work for most folks.\\nCBT helps to evaluate and understand different schemas (ways of thinking) a person may have. These schemas can at times be a lens of negativity (e.g. assuming the worst) which can result in impacting our core beliefs about the world. Once we identify unhelpful schemas, we begin to monitor by documenting through thought records, journaling, mood-behaviour tracking, or being aware of physical feelings happening within us. This helps us identify patterns of thinking and actions, and where opportunities lay to break the cycle.\\nTake for example stress. Generally, it is not good. When we begin to pay attention to our stressors, we can evaluate if they are avoidable, or unavoidable. Areas that we may be able to change include environments, routines, or social surroundings. For unavoidable stress, we can use coping skills. Things like diaphragmatic/mindful breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or exercise can help with this. Lastly, sometimes motivation does not come naturally, in these circumstances, try to remember that action precedes motivation - sometimes we do it, even when we don\\u2019t feel like it.\\nAnother way to help in accomplishing goals is activity scheduling. Building enjoyable or healthy activities into our schedule can help us stay accountable to doing them. Try to remove obstacles that may slow you down or dissuade you. Specific goals are easier to follow through, SMART goals can help keep you on track: Specific Measurable Achievable Relevant Time-bound\"), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"strategies-for-challenging-unhelpful-thoughts\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\"\n    }\n  }, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"h2\",\n    \"href\": \"#strategies-for-challenging-unhelpful-thoughts\",\n    \"aria-label\": \"strategies for challenging unhelpful thoughts permalink\",\n    \"className\": \"anchor before\"\n  }, mdx(\"svg\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"aria-hidden\": \"true\",\n    \"focusable\": \"false\",\n    \"height\": \"16\",\n    \"version\": \"1.1\",\n    \"viewBox\": \"0 0 16 16\",\n    \"width\": \"16\"\n  }, mdx(\"path\", {\n    parentName: \"svg\",\n    \"fillRule\": \"evenodd\",\n    \"d\": \"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"\n  }))), \"Strategies for challenging unhelpful thoughts:\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Avoid \\u201Call or nothing\\u201D thinking.\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Try not to overgeneralize situations or people.\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Keep an open mind.

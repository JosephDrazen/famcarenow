## Transtheoretical Model

In	this	weeks	session,	KJ	Thomas MSW,RSW and	Jillian	Crabbe MSW,RSW facilitated	with guest	speaker;	
Chris	Curry, BA	(Hons),	RP,	MHA	Dip,		presenting	on	the	Transtheoretical	Model	(TTM).

TTM,	also	known	as	The	Stages	of	Change	is	a	framework of	talk	therapy	which	looks	at	a	person’s
readiness	to	make	change	in	their	life	towards	a	healthier	behaviour.	It	consists	of six	stages	that	help	
determine	where	a	person	is	at,	and	what	actions	they	may	be	willing	to	take:

**Precontemplation** - no	intention	to	make	change.	A	person	may	be	unaware	of	a	problematic	behaviour,	
or	feel	the	cons	of	changing outweigh	the	positives.	

**Contemplation** - intention	to	change in	foreseen	future.	A	person	may	see	their behaviour	as	problematic,	
or	be	beginning	to	see	alternative	ways	of	living.	

**Preparation** - intention	to	change	in	the	near	future.	Small	steps	are	being	planned,	beliefs	that	change	can	
help	their	quality	of	life.	

**Action** - change	underway.	Steps	have	been	taken	with	a	plan	to	keep	moving	forward.	This	can	include	
modifying	or	developing	healthier	behaviours	in	place.	

**Maintenance** - change	has	been	sustained	for	at	least	six	months.	People	plan	to	continue	moving	forward	
and	working	to	prevent	relapse.	

**Relapse	&	Recycle** - represents	that	a	person	may	encounter	a	relapse	during	their	recovery	road.	
Evidence	shows	that	many	people	experience	this,	and	it	can	be	a	normal	part	of	making	changes.	This	
period	can	also	be	a	teaching	tool	helping	folks	learn	about	themselves,	and	where	to	make	different	
choices	moving	forward.	

When	discussing	addictions,	remember	to	keep	the	person	first	(do	not	use	words	like	“addict,	junkie,	
crackhead,	etc.”).While	there	are	many	who	overcome	addictions	on	their	own,	others	seek	assistance.	In	
some	severe	circumstances,	quitting	can	lead	to	strong	physical	side	effects	and	anxiety,	and	medical	
intervention is	needed	to	safely	detox.	Addiction	change,	does	not	always	equal	abstinence.	When	a	person	
has	addiction	issues,	polysubstance use is	common	(multiple	substances	being	used).	Many	will	choose	one	
thing	at a	time	to	reduce	or	quit,	known	as	harm	reduction. Harm	reduction	is	the	conscious	effort	to	
reduce or	modify a	harmful	habit.

Fentanyl	overdoses	have sky	rocketed	over	the	years,	and	it	has	become	an	extremely	dangerous	drug.	
Street	drugs	can	be	cut	with	Fentanyl	or	other	unknown	substances	to	give	a	greater	“high”.	Used	
unknowingly,	or	incorrectly	this	can	lead	to	serious	harm	or	death. Medications	such	as	Methadone,	
Suboxone,	Sublocade,	Naltrexone	and	Remeron	have	been	shown	to	help	with	cravings	and	withdrawal
from	certain	substances. Talk	to	your	doctor	to	learn	more.


Cannabis	legalization	has	sent	an	implicit	message	that	it	is	a	harmless	drug.	While	many	will	use	cannabis	
without	negative	effects,	those	who	are	pre-disposed	to	a	mental	illness	are	at	higher	risk	of	psychosis,	or	if	
currently	unwell,	worsening	psychosis.	When	making	a	decision	to	use	cannabis,	it’s	important	to	know	
your/	family mental	health	history.	

## The	“do’s	and	don’ts”	of	supporting	a	loved	one	overcoming	addiction:


- Maintain	a	supportive,	non-judgemental	stance	while	meeting	a	person	in	the	stage	they	are	at.	
- Change	is	a	personal	journey.	Trying	to	force	change	can	damage	relationships.	
- Celebrate	the	small	changes	made, these	are	victories.
- Interventions,	confrontation,	blaming/shaming, and	ultimatums	have	not	shown	to	be	helpful	
methods	to	support	change.	
- With	permission,	help	a person	set	goals. SMART	goals	(Specific,	Measurable,	Attainable,	
Realistic,	Time-bound).	Cost-benefit	analysis	can	also	help	change.	
- Addiction	is	lonely; remain	emotionally	supportive	and	loving whenever	possible.	
- Boundaries	are	an	important	part	of	self-care but	should	also	be	approached	empathetically.	
Virtual	meet	ups	can	be	helpful	when	physical	visits	are	not possible.	
- Addiction	management	can	be	life	long.	Acknowledge	the	difficulty	of	change, and empathize	with	
setbacks.

## About

This is Level 1 & 2 of the Pyramid of Family Care.

At the bottom of the pyramid, Levels 1 (connection and assessment) and 2 (general education) indicate the minimum
level of service that should be available to all family caregivers. These services could be provided by mental health
service providers in the formal system and by family caregiver organizations whose primary clients are family caregivers.
The need for Level 1 and 2 interventions should be reassessed at each point of contact.
